# Fortune Foo

A practice project!

Create an application to tell a fortune for a user.

* Use React and Redux

* Phase 1, create a button when you click it alerts a box with a default fortune. `good things are headed your way!`

* Phase 2, incorporate redux and the `fortune-cookie` npm module with a random function, to dynamically select a fortune.

* Phase 3, take input from the user and use it to augment the random criteria in some way. Some data elements to capture:

* Initial of first or last name
* Age or Year born
* Eye or Hair color

Make each of these answers some sort of numeric factor and then adjust your random selections based on the input.

* Phase 4, move the fortune process to an api so that you can call your fortune algorithm via an api call.

* Phase 5, create a react native version using nativebase.io and expo.io

* Phase 6, add pouchdb as a local document database and enable users to store their fortunes and see a history of their fortunes over time, maybe let them create a note if they came true or not? Also don't allow the engine to do the same prediction for the same user.

* Phase 7, give the user the option to share their fortune with friends via twitter.

* Phase 8, use keen.io to create metric for every user and their fortunes

* Phase 9, create an online dashboard that enables any one to see de-identified metrics on fortunes.
